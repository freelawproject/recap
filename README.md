Reporting Issues
================

This repository is a centralized place for filing [issues](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap/issues) on any [RECAP](https://free.law/recap)-related effort. When you file an issue, please search to make sure no one else has already reported that issue. If you open a new issue, please use labels to indicate which component(s) are affected (firefox, chrome, affects all browsers, server, etc.) and whether you are reporting a "bug" or requesting an "enhancement."
